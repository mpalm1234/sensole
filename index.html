          Sensole is an insole biometric monitoring device for Parkinson’s
          patients that acts as both a bridge between the doctor’s office and a
          patient’s daily activities, and as a research tool to further understand
          potential diagnosis patterns and disease progression.  At the same time,
          Sensole empowers patients to take part in their own healthcare.

        <p>
          Sensole is a product spawned by UD researchers who lacked a way to
          collect accurate and natural gait data from Parkinson’s patients they
          were studying. Once the idea was formed the founders worked with the
          University of Delaware’s Office of Economic Innovation and
          Partnerships program to create a team of Undergraduate students to
          bring our idea it fruition. After countless exploration, prototypes,
          and testing we are now running clinical trials validating Sensoles
          unique value.

        <h4>Helping Parkinson's Patients One Step at a Time</h4>
        <p>
          Parkinson's Disease (PD)  is a neurodegenerative disease that
          progressively takes away a person’s  ability to walk. In the U.S.,
          there are over 1 million people with PD  and more than 60,000 people
          diagnosed with the disease each year.  Based  on previous UD research,
          Resonate Forward, LLC (RF) has developed an  untethered, vibration
          therapy technology that has shown improvement in  the disabling gait
          disorders caused by PD.  Resonate Forward is currently in the
          prototype development and clinical trial stage.
        </p>

        <h4>Customer Need</h4>
        <p>
          Every  person with Parkinson’s disease (PD) progresses differently but
          the reality of PD is that the disease progressively begins to take away
          functional abilities and ultimately their independence.  PD often takes
          away the ability to do fine motor tasks, ability to communicate clearly,
          the ability to show emotion, and the ability to walk independently.
          This progression can happen very slowly over 10 years or over a few
          short years. As PD is diagnosed, people are seeking solutions that can
          slow disease progression and give back the independence that the disease
          process has taken away.  Gait disorders are a hallmark feature and one
          of the most incapacitating symptoms of PD.  Freezing of gait (FOG) is
          the most elusive and  disabling of the gait disorders. FOG is described
          by people with PD as the feeling of their feet being stuck to the
          ground and not being able to take a step. FOG often results in falls
          leading to serious injury and reduction of a person’s independence,
          activity, and quality of life.  Approximately 60% of people with PD
          suffer with FOG.  More  than one million people have PD in the USA and
          over 10 million  worldwide suffer from this incurable neurodegenerative
          disease.  Approximately 60,000 patients are diagnosed each year in the
          U.S. alone.  Only 5-10% of people with PD are under 40, the average
          age of diagnosis is 60.  The disease occurs slightly more in men than
          women.  Incidence of the disease increases with age as 1 in 100 over
          60, and 1 in 20 over 80 have PD. The cost of PD, including treatment,
          disability payments (social security) and lost wages, is estimated to
          be nearly $25  billion/ year in the United States.
        </p>

        <h4>The Hypothesis</h4>
        <p>
          In Parkinson's the basal ganglia, that controls movement is damaged.
          The communication from the motor cortex and peripheral nerves is short
          circuited causing symptoms of shuffling, slowness, freezing, tremor.
          The hypothesis is that the specific vibration stimulates peripheral
          nerves and somehow smoothes the communication channel to the brain.
          We hope to bring this laboratory technology to commercialization.
